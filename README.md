# Zero-and-Poles-locator-with-GUI

With this desktop application using Python and PyQt you can draw using your mouse multiple zeros and poles on a unit circle and the corresponding frequency response will be shown.

So if you wanna make high pass or low pass filter by adding zeros and poles then their frequency response will be shown to you

* You can drag the previous drawn zeros or poles to modify their position
* You can also delete any of zeroes or poles you have drawn
* You can save the zero or poles in .txt File on your computer
* You can browse any previous drawn zeros or poles into the unit circle from .txt files, or have been made manually by writing the coordinates of the zeros and poles in the .txt (each coordinate in a line)
